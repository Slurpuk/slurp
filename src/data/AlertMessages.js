/*
CUSTOM ERROR CODES:

#0001: Users have a database model associated with their auth model.
The user model has to be verified to exist before going ahead with authentication
(regardless of whether there is an authentication model or not).
This error code is caused by finding a database model (in users, the 'Users model')
but no auth model. This mean there has been a fault in the creation of the user.
This error should never happen.
